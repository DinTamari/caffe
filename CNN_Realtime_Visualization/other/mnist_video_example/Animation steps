After running digit_plots_video_run.py and obtaining a set of plot figures.

To process figures and make into gif:

In terminal on folder path (Linux):

The following takes an image and chops off the right side by 200 pixels
convert  input_name.jpg -gravity East -chop 200x0 output_name.jpg

To do it for a whole bunch of images (from the current directory) and have the chopped out ones placed in the directory /chopped (need to specify file format: can convert to .png at this step!)
mogrify -path /chopped -format jpg -gravity East -chop 200x0 *.jpg

When done, to make the gif animation of all .jpg files in folder, with delay 40ms between each and loop 0 (= continue to loop):
convert -delay 40 -loop 0 *.jpg outputname.gif
