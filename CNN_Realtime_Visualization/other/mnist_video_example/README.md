# Other: Making digit plots into short gif video

1. Need to download and parse dataset of images and labels from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
   test-images folder with 10'000 digit images already made available  
   If you wish to process more, the file parse_data.py provides a good starting point to understand how
   (obtained from https://gist.github.com/ischlag/41d15424e7989b936c1609b53edd1390)
2. Set folder names / parameters of visualization in params.py
3. Run the digit_plots_video_run.py file
4. This should create the set of figures. To turn into a video, see the "Animation steps" file
